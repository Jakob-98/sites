          <p>The bot itself was taking lines from a certain book and tweeting them. No real coding experience is required for this, and the initial setup was done in about 5 minutes. I was quite astonished to see the amount of impressions my twitter bot made over about a two week period: </p>

          <p>If you are interested in hosting your own twitter bot, you can do it by following the next easy steps:  </p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">First create a twitter developer account</h2>
          <p>Go to <a href='appts.twitter.com'>apps.twitter.com</a> to create an account and get your credentials needed to authenticate your twitter bot. Since I use a public GitHub page for version control, I saved my API credentials in a separate tokens.txt file which was added to the .gitignore. It is suggested you do something similar to prevent others from accessing your twitter credentials.  </p>
          <h2 class='section-heading'>Then set-up your twitter bot. </h2>
          <p>Start by installing tweepy, the easiest method is using pip: </p>
          <pre class='text-muted'> 
            <code>
              pip install tweepy
            </code>
          </pre>

          <pre class='text-muted'> 
            <code>
              import tweepy
              import os
              from createMsg import Message

              #import token from token.txt
              token_file = os.path.join('../', "token.txt")

              tokens = open(token_file,'r')

              for line in tokens:
                  keys = line.split(';')
                  CONSUMER_KEY = keys[0]
                  CONSUMER_SECRET = keys[1]
                  ACCESS_TOKEN = keys[2]
                  ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = keys[3]

            </code>
          </pre>
            <p>test123s</p>
            <pre>
            <code class='text-muted'>
              # Authenticate to Twitter
              auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET)
              auth.set_access_token(ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)

              # Create API object
              api = tweepy.API(auth)

              # Create a tweet
              api.update_status(message)

            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>I ended up hosting the twitter bot in my DigitalOcean virtual machine for a week or two, and the resulting tweets were gaining around 450-500 impressions each. I’m certain the broad reach was caused by my use of hashtags which gained a fair amount of traction. The actual interaction with my user profile was quite low. I’m currently working on a smarter, more interactive version of this bot, which will hopefully gain a higher amount of real-user interaction with the tweets it made. Stay tuned for a new blog for the updated twitter bot coming soon!</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Admittance rates weren't the same across departments.</h2>
          <p>Certain departments at UC Berkeley were harder to get admitted in. Taking this into account is of critical importance. The overall admittance rates decrease from (unnamed) departments A through F for both sexes. This is the first indication that the original data might have been misleading. However, this alone is not enough to explain the discrepancy between the two admittance rates. Let's take a look at the amount of male and female applicants per department.</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">From these departments, women apply more often to ones which are harder to get into.
          </h2>
          <p>As is seen in the visualization below, male applicants apply more often to the departments which are 'easier' to get in for both sexes. This is opposite for women, as they seem to apply to departments which are harder to get into. This is another indicator that the unsegregated data might tell another story than the aggregated data. One piece of the story, however, is still missing. What about the admittance rate per sex per department?</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">The differences in admittance rates between departments are very similar.</h2>
          <p>The difference is minimal. In fact: in certain cases, you can even see the admittance rates for women being higher than that of men. Combining these three numerical facts gives us a clear view of the actual reasoning behind the original discrepancy. Admittance rates are similar per department, or even significantly higher for women, but women don't apply to 'easier' the departments as often as men do. Below is an overview of the visualization.</p>

            <img class="img-fluid" src="media/truth2.png" alt="">
          </a>


          <h2 class="section-heading">So how do we arrive at the original discrepancy?</h2>

          <p>From this point it is simple to find the problem: multiply the amount of female applicants by their admittance rates per department and you get the numbers 44% and 35%. As we see, this is how we get to the original discrepancy in admittance rates between men and women.</p>
          <a href="media/truth3.png">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="media/truth3.png" alt="">

          <a href="media/truth4.png">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="media/truth4.png" alt="">
          </a>
          <p>In the end, this does not seem to have been a case of sex bias, but a case of something which is known as the Simpon's Paradox. The Simpson's Paradox is one of many statistical fallacies which we fall for in our daily lives. Berkeley wasn't sued, and there was no implicated sex bias for admittance rates. Why there was such a significant difference between the amount of applicants for the department is debatable, and a subject for a different story. The key thing to understand is that, sometimes, data and visualizations can create a story which does not align with reality. In these cases it is important to be a critical thinker, or to have access to a good statistician to do the thinking for you.</p>
