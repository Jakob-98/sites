Idea: build 3d game of life.

Use websockets for 'players' to edit the field.
Field is saved.
Camera position determines position on map
objects have metadata (color? for player) -> players can keep track of their score.

Use threejs examples:
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples
dynamic/performance/aother one (see examples) from instancing

Only view X amount in view, then 'fade out'

Idea: 
start with 2d version, expand on 3d later. Same idea, also threejs.
